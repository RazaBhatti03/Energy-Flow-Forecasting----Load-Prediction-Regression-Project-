#  Energy Flow Forecasting â€” Zone 1 Load Prediction (Regression Project)

Forecasting energy flow accurately is essential for optimizing power distribution, reducing energy waste, and planning future infrastructure. In this project, we build a robust regression model to predict **Zone 1 energy flow** using environmental and time-based factors such as temperature, humidity, time, and diffuse solar flows.

---

##  Objective

- Build a regression model to predict `Zone 1` energy usage.
- Perform complete EDA, feature engineering, and multivariate analysis.
- Improve model accuracy using hyperparameter tuning and ensemble learning.
- Handle time-related and nonlinear relationships in the dataset.

---

##  Business Problem

Energy demand forecasting helps:
- Utility companies optimize power generation and prevent overloads.
- Governments and industries reduce energy waste and operational cost.
- Engineers and planners design efficient smart grids.

| Zone 1 (Target)        | Energy flow in Zone 1 (Watts)                         |

**Extracted Features:**
- `hour`, `dayofweek`, `month`, `is_weekend`

##  Steps Performed

###  1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled mixed datetime formats.
- Removed outliers using IQR method.
- Converted `DateTime` into multiple time-based features.

###  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualizations.
- Outlier and distribution analysis using histograms, boxplots, pairplots.
- Time-based usage patterns extracted using heatmaps.

###  3. Feature Engineering
- Extracted `hour`, `dayofweek`, `month`, `is_weekend` from datetime.
- Removed low-importance features based on:
  - RandomForest feature importance
  - Mutual Information scores

###  4. Model Building & Evaluation
- Tried multiple regression models:
  - Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Evaluated using:
  - RÂ² Score, RMSE, MAE on train/test sets
- Used `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning

###  5. Final Model & Deployment Readiness
- Best model: `RandomForestRegressor` (RÂ² â‰ˆ 94% on test set)
- Saved model pipeline using `joblib`
- Ready to deploy on new data with consistent preprocessing

## ðŸ“ˆ Results & Performance

Below is the comparison of model performance **before and after feature engineering & hyperparameter tuning**:

| Metric                | Baseline Model: Decision Tree | Final Model: Random Forest |
|------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| RÂ² Score (Train)       | 100.00%                      | 99.60%                     |
| RÂ² Score (Test)        | 94.01%                       | 97.28%                     |
| Mean Squared Error     | 3,039,939.14                 | 1,381,976.13               |
| Mean Absolute Error    | 1,003.55                     | 787.86                     |
| RÂ² Score (as float)    | 0.940                        | 0.973                      |
| Top Features           | `diffuse flows`, `general diffuse flows`, `Temperature` | Same (confirmed via model) |

### ðŸš€ Key Improvements:
- RÂ² score on test data improved from **94.01% â†’ 97.28%**
- MSE reduced by **~54.5%**, showing significantly lower prediction error
- MAE dropped from **1,003.55 to 787.86**, indicating more accurate predictions
- Final model is more generalized and avoids overfitting (better test vs train match)
